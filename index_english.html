          <p>I'm José Douglas</p>
          <p>First of all. Let me introduce myself. I won't take your time. I'm a Majoring in Bachelor of Information Systems at IFAL - Instituto Federal de Alagoas (7th Semester) I think it is a very important and fascinating area, as it involves the use of technologies to manage and process data and information.</p>

          <h2>Occupation Area</h2>
          <p>About me: Hello, welcome I am a professional passionate about DevOps and exploring the infinite possibilities that technology can offer.
             With the experience that college proposed to me, in Linux, Windows, Python, Docker, Git, Terraform, Ansible and AWS, my goal is to drive innovation and efficiency,
              building smart solutions for complex challenges. My journey in the technology universe began with a fascination for the power of automation. Over the years,
               I developed solid skills in Linux environments, where I learned to master command line tools and deal with diverse challenges in infrastructure and server
                administration. Learning Python was a natural step, as it allowed me to create customized solutions and automate repetitive tasks, optimizing the workflow
                 of entire teams. My enthusiasm for container technologies led me to the world of Docker. If it runs on a Docker, it will probably run on the production server.
                  I learned the importance of version control through Git, a fundamental ally in collaborative projects. As an avid advocate of collaboration and teamwork,
                   I see Git as an indispensable tool for a smooth and conflict-free workflow. Infrastructure orchestration is one of my main interests, and my experience with
                    Terraform allowed me to create and manage infrastructures as code. Ansible with its ability to automate configuration, deployment and server management makes
                     it possible to create efficient and highly reliable solutions. My trajectory in cloud computing led me to AWS (Amazon Web Services). I am driven by
                      challenges and passionate about learning constantly. I believe that technology can transform lives and businesses, and my goal is to create solutions
                       that make the world more connected, efficient and accessible. If you share the same interest in DevOps, automation and innovation, or if you are looking
                        for someone to contribute to complex projects in a dynamic team environment, I am always open to new opportunities and collaborations.
                         Let’s build the future together through technology! And to close, I am learning English which I see is very important for my area in every way.
                          I am at the intermediate level and advancing more and more. Thank you very much for reading this far.</p>
